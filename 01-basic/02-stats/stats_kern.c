    This definition represents a BPF map object named 'counters', that is of type
    'BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY'. Because this type is not a PERCPU version it is NOT thread safe.
    Meaning any manipulation of the map itself should be guarded using locking.

    The key pieces of information defined here describe how the map can be interacted with.
        - 'type' is likely the most important piece as it describes the memory layout and functionality of the map.
        - 'key_size' sets the _size_ of the key used to lookup, insert, update, or delete elements.
        - 'value_size' sets the _size_ of the values stored at a given key.
        - 'max_entries' determines the number of keys and therefore values that can be stored in this map.
